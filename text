Washington (CNN)Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton continue to lead their respective presidential primaries, according to a new Fox News poll Wednesday, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has closed the gap as candidates have dropped out of the race.
Trump leads Cruz 41% to 38% in the GOP race among likely Republican voters, with John Kasich behind at 17%. But the race has tightened: In February, when candidates including Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio were still in the race, Cruz was at 19% and Trump 36%.
Recent polls show Trump between 47% and 41% and Cruz between 31% and 26%. This is the only poll that meets CNN standards in which Cruz is polling above 35%.
